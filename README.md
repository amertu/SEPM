Web application in a 4+-layers architecture which simplifies the internal processes of the restaurant management via a digital solution.

## Project Description
By developing a multi-user system, everyday operational activities can be managed simply and easily. The respective target groups have different overviews and rights that enable them to implement common work processes physically and virtually. Specifically, the owner is able to create waiters and assign roles as an administrator. Taking and handling reservations is considerably simplified via an interactive user interface. For example, the availability of individual tables is checked automatically in order to avoid overlaps. Furthermore, the creation of invoices is made easier for waiters - these can be immediately available for printing via PDF export.

## Use case overview
1. User management: Since the waiter has fewer permissions than the owner, user management is required.

2. Table management: For table reservation it is necessary to be able to create the tables of the restaurant in the system. 
However, this does not necessarily have to be done interactively.

3. Table reservation: The functionality of the table reservation must be given through interactive, graphical reservation functionality.

4. Invoices: Dishes should be able to be added to an invoice. The invoice should be able to be exported as a PDF and show the names and prices of the products as well as the invoice total.

Instructions how to run both backend and frontend of this application are provided in the corresponding reedme.
