## Project Description
* Restaurant management app.
* Used by waiters and the owner.
* Handling of reservations.
* Invoice creation.

## Use case overview
1. User management: Since the waiter has fewer permissions than the owner, user management is required.

2. Table management: For table reservation it is necessary to be able to create the tables of the restaurant in the system. 
However, this does not necessarily have to be done interactively.

3. Table reservation: The functionality of the table reservation must be given. A sophisticated interactive, graphical reservation functionality is not mandatory.

4. Invoices: Dishes should be able to be added to an invoice. The invoice should be able to be exported as a PDF and show the names and prices of the products as well as the invoice total.
